# Hello!! 
### I am a computer science student based out of Jersey City, New Jersey with a particular technical interests in many areas of computer science like machine learning and systems/security, but I also have a great interest in physics and engineering! Outside of the technical sphere, I have a strong personal desire to comment, question, and criticize technological advancements against how it is good for society.
